# Complete CI/CD Pipeline Project

## Overview
This repository demonstrates a **complete CI/CD pipeline** built with modern DevOps tools and best practices.  
The project covers containerization, orchestration, CI/CD automation, monitoring, and publishing Docker images to Docker Hub.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Docker / Docker Compose** â†’ Containerization & local multi-service setup  
- **Kubernetes (K8s)** â†’ Orchestration and scaling of services  
- **Helm** â†’ Kubernetes package management and templating  
- **GitHub Actions** â†’ Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline  
- **Argo CD** â†’ Continuous Deployment (CD) using GitOps  
- **Prometheus & Grafana** â†’ Monitoring, metrics, and dashboards  
- **Docker Hub** â†’ Container image registry for storing and sharing built images  

---

## Workflow
1. **Dockerfile** â€“ Build container images for the application  
2. **Docker Compose** â€“ Run multiple services locally for development/testing  
3. **Kubernetes** â€“ Deploy services to a cluster for scalability and reliability  
4. **Helm Charts** â€“ Manage and deploy Kubernetes manifests in a reusable way  
5. **GitHub Actions** â€“ Automate CI: build, test, and push images to **Docker Hub**  
6. **Argo CD** â€“ Automate CD: deploy changes to Kubernetes using GitOps model  
7. **Prometheus + Grafana** â€“ Collect and visualize metrics for observability

## Setup & Usage

### Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Israr8/Complete_CI-CD_pipline_Project.git
cd Complete_CI-CD_pipline_Project
```

### Run with Docker Compose
```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

### Deploy to Kubernetes with Helm
```bash
helm install <release-name> ./helm
# Upgrade existing release
helm upgrade <release-name> ./helm
```

---

## GitHub Actions (CI)
Runs automatically on every **push** or **pull request**.  
Workflow steps include:

- âœ… Build Docker images  
- âœ… Run tests (if defined)  
- âœ… Push built images to Docker Hub  

---

## Argo CD (CD)
- ðŸ”„ Continuously monitors this repository  
- ðŸš€ Automatically deploys any changes in Helm or Kubernetes manifests to the cluster  

---

## Monitoring
- ðŸ“Š **Prometheus** scrapes application and cluster metrics  
- ðŸ“ˆ **Grafana** provides dashboards and visualizations  
- ðŸ”” Alerts can be configured using **Prometheus Alertmanager**  

---

## Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose  
- Kubernetes cluster (local: Minikube/kind, or cloud: GKE/EKS/AKS)  
- Helm CLI installed  
- Argo CD installed in cluster  
- Prometheus & Grafana (can be installed via Helm charts)  
- Docker Hub account with repository access  
- GitHub account with Actions enabled  

---

## Improvements (Future Scope)
- Add unit and integration tests  
- Configure blue/green or canary deployments  
- Setup SSL/TLS with cert-manager  
- Extend monitoring with logs (Grafana Loki / ELK stack)  
- Implement auto rollback on failed deployments  

---
